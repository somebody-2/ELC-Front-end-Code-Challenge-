# ELC Front-end Code Challenge 

1. Before coding
    * Step_1: install all dependencies.
    * Step_2: run `npm start` or `yarn start` to build a local server.
    * Step_3: visit http://localhost:3000/ to check the website is working.


2. Requirement:
    * We need a global popup method.
    * When we call this method, a notification will show up in top-right of the screen. and disappear automatically after 3 seconds.
    * When you call it several times, all notifications will list in top-right of the screen.
    * Make the notification looks like the [Alert component in MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-alert/), without installing MUI.
    * Please don't leverage any third-part module.

3. Nice to have:
    * Unit test.
    * Add debounce for click event (0.5s).
    * Expand it to handle more business scenarios, based on your experience.

4. We hope see:
    * Clear code and logic.
    * Self-explain code and comments.
